											<h3>Plot</h3>
											<p>The name Cytus is taken from Cocytus, the Greek mythological river of wailing or lamentation.
											Cytus features a story plot that is carried through its 10 main chapters as well as a prologue.
											The story revolves around the protagonist, Vanessa, who lives in a 22nd-century world where robots 
											with human memories are the only remaining sentient beings while living humans are killed by a mutant virus.
											Due to limited memory space, human emotions are stored in the form of music in "Cytus", and by playing the
											songs, the robots are able to revive their human emotions. The plot features the disaster and the protagonist's struggle with identity.
											The story is told in-game through various cut-scenes that are unique to the chapter 
											title songs; in comparison, the other individual songs within each chapter are at most only marginally relevant 
											to the plot, except for a limited few.</p>

										<h3>Gameplay</h3>
										<p>The main gameplay of Cytus features the Active Scan Line, a black line that move up and down across the screen.
										The player taps circular objects, referred to as Notes, as the Active Scan Line passes over them, following the music.</p>
										<p>Three types of Notes are used. The Click Note, a single circular note, requires tapping the object in time.
										The Drag Note, a continuous track of notes, requires dragging along the track. The Hold Note, a note with an extended ribbon meter, 
										requires holding over the note until the meter is filled. Notes to be hit as the line rises are colored blue and purple, while those 
										as the line drops are colored yellow and green.</p>
										<p>Each Note is judged by the accuracy to be either Perfect, Good, Bad or Miss. The better the accuracy, the higher score is given. 
										The maximum score is 1,000,000, and a minimum of 700,000 is required to clear a stage. After a stage ends, various metrics are provided 
										to show the player's performance, including score, TP, a letter grade, and numbers of hits in each type of judgement.</p>

										<h3>Releases and Pricing</h3>
										<p>Cytus is available through the Apple App Store and Google Play. The full game charges a base price 
										plus optional in-app purchases for players to purchase additional chapters of playable songs.</p>
										<p>The release on Google Play is free but features a cooldown timer before starting each song. 
										The cooldown will be removed when the full price is paid.</p>
										<p>The PlayStation Vita and PlayStation Mobile port Cytus: Lambda includes the then-exclusive chapter Prologue:
										Live, otherwise identical to its smartphone releases. A teaser video was released onto YouTube prior
										to release on June 7, 2013.</p>
										<h4>Million Downloads Plan</h4>
										<p>Rayark Games announced the Million Downloads Plan (literally: "hundred new songs, million downloads") 
										in the wake of "illegal piracy harming the sales figures of Cytus".Starting from Version 2.0.0, a 10-song chapter
										will be made available to all players for free for each 100,000 paid downloads achieved, up to a million paid downloads or
										ten chapters. The plan is completed with Version 8.0, released in July 2015, opening ten chapters for free, 
										including the special Chapter Million featuring remixes of past songs.</p>
										<h3>Other media</h3>
										<h4>Soundtrack</h4>
										<p>Multiple Cytus soundtracks have been released both on iTunes and as physical CD, 
										featuring playable music and background composition from the game. Cytus -Prologue-, 
										was released on April 1, 2012, Cytus -Hindsight- on December 10, 2013and Cytus -Foresight- 
										on December 28, 2013. A story album called Cytus -Alive- has also been released on August 20, 2012; 
										the album features songs composed by Sta and Cranky with the same names as the ten chapters of the game.
										Each song corresponds to each chapter in the story plot.</p>

										 <h3>Cytus Omega<h3>
										 	<p>Cytus Omega is an upcoming arcade game based off from Cytus.
										 	It is a collaboration between Rayark and Capcom, and will feature existing and new songs in the game.</p>
										 <h4>Story</h4>
										 	<p>"A world that has revived after a disaster-The human race, which was thought to have gone extinct 
										 	after an unprecedented catastrophe, is resuscitated by the Operators and the memories stored in the Cytus.</p>
										 	<p>Relying on the memories stored in the Operators, humans started rebuilding their world - a world where humans and androids live together.</p>
										 	<p>The Cytus, where the memories are stored, was an extremely secret compartment that only certain individuals can access.</p>
										 	<p>One day, the main character wakes in a pod. Looking around, she sees that she is in a laboratory. However, she doesn't remember 
										 	a thing about her identity, and doesn't know her own motives. In her clouded consciousness, a shadow moves across her vision.
										 	Chasing after the shadow, she sees a terminal with "Cytus" written on it.</p>
										 	<p>The main character accesses the Cytus, and she will start recovering her memories through music."</p>
