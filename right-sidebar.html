										<h3>Gameplay</h3>
										<p>The core gameplay of Deemo is a score-based music video game. Each playable song features three levels, namely Easy, Normal and Hard
										, each given a difficulty rating measured in a 'Level' scale. The levels were originally being ranged between 1 to 10, however the 
										introduction of the Level 11 song Myosotis in the 2.0 version marks the extension of the levels range, now being ranged from 1 to 11. 
										The player can also customize the speed of the notes before starting a level, in a scale of 1 (slowest) to 9 (fastest).</p>
										<p>In each level, a black line is affixed at the bottom of the screen, and horizontal bars known as "notes" approach the line at a perspective from
										background to foreground. The player must tap on the notes when they coincides with the bottom line in time with the music, resembling
										playing on a piano. Black notes requires the player to tap each individually, while yellow notes allows the player to slide across in a 
										chain. Black notes with a white interior is the same as normal black notes, only representing non-piano sounds.</p>
										<p>The player's performance is judged by the accuracy at which each note is hit, where a "Charming" hit is more accurate than a normal
										hit. At the end of each level, the game shows the player's overall performance in a result screen, providing the proportion of 
										"Charming" hits, the longest chain of consecutive successful hits (Combo), and the overall accuracy in percentage form, with 
										100% denoting all hits are "Charming". The result screen will congratulate the player for hitting all notes successfully 
										(Full Combo) or achieving 100% accuracy (All Charming). The level is considered completed when a 65% or up accuracy is achieved.</p>
										<h3>Releases</h3>
										<p>Deemo was released on November 13, 2013 on the AppStore, and December 27, 2013 on Google Play for Android devices. 
										The Android version is a free trial only allowing limited progress, the full version of which can be unlocked by in-app purchases.</p>
										<p>Deemo: Last Recital for the PlayStation Vita is expected to be released on June 24, 2015 in Japan exclusively as downloadable
										software. Different from mobile releases, Last Recital will include additional modes for cooperative and competitive play,
										and extra story exclusive to this version. Cutscenes will be remade with full animation produced by CoMix Wave Films.
										All lines by the little girl with be voiced in Japanese by voice actor Ayana Taketatsu.</p>
										<p>The game's ending songs are titled "Sakurairo no Yume" ( Sakurairo no yume, lit. Cherry-Colored Dream) by Chihiro Toki and "Alice Good Night" by Riin for the 2.0 version.</p>

											<h3>Plot</h3>
											<p>The game's plot centers around an unnamed little girl that fell from an open trapdoor in the sky, and a black, mysterious character
											Deemo who, to help the girl return to her own world, plays piano music to grow a special tree sapling sprouting from the piano. As 
											the tree grows, various rooms of the structure opens for the girl to explore. The girl also encounters a person wearing a white gown
											and mask, referred to as the "Masked Lady", who expresses resentment towards Deemo and the girl trying to grow the tree.</p>
											<p>The tree stops growing at a 20-meter height. The girl discovers a stairway through a painting in a side room and walks into 
											the painting with Deemo. The stairway leads to a chamber with another piano covered in thick thorns. As Deemo plays on that piano,
											large-scale trembling happens in the structure, and the tree resumes growth.</p>
											<p>The tree stops growing again at the final 50-meter height, which unlocks a final room from thorns. As the girl and Deemo enter 
											the room, the Masked Lady grabs hold of the girl, and the two struggle. Deemo stops the Masked Lady with pats on her head, and proceeds
											into the room with the girl, leaving the Masked Lady behind.</p>
											<p>The final room contains a piano and a hovering platform. Deemo plays more piano music which builds a stairway to reach the platform.
											When the stairway is full built, Deemo carries the girl up the staircases and raises her onto the platform, then returns to the piano to
											play one final tune. The playable song ends with the message "Goodbye, my beloved sister, Alice.", suggesting the girl's name.</p>
											<p>As the song finishes, Deemo is revealed to be a manifestation of Alice's elder brother Hans, and gradually disintegrates. A series of
											flashback scenes reveals the siblings were involved in a fatal traffic accident, where Hans sacrificed himself to save Alice. Alice
											bursts into tears as the platform elevates towards the trapdoor. The Masked Lady removes her hood and mask, revealing to be another 
											Alice. Alice then wakes up in a hospital bed, attached with medical instruments. She removes them and rushes to the window only to find 
											that she was in a coma the whole time and that her brother is really dead. She then collapses into tears and nurses rush to her side to
											try and comfort her.</p>

											from multiple regions including Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong. Notable contributors include Earthbound Papas and guitarist 
											Shinichi Kobayashi. Deemo also uses songs that were used in Cytus, another rhythm game by the same developer and songs from Alim's
											Role-playing game Brave Frontier for the game's collaboration event.</p>
